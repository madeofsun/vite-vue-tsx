# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with SFC-less Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite.

The template uses Vue 3 Composition API with `vue-tsx-macros` that brings typescript specific `<script setup>` features to `.tsx` files (like defining props using type declarations - `defineProps`).

That allows you to remove burdensome tooling like `vue-tsc` / `Volar` and still get same experience in terms of type-safety.

Check out the [docs](https://github.com/madeofsun/vue-tsx-macros) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- With this setup you can use any IDE that support Typescript and you do NOT need any additional tooling like `Volar` / `Vetur` / `TypescriptVuePlugin`
